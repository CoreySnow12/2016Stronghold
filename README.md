Welcome! This is where I test everything in one file to make sure it works together.

Things included in this project:
- NavX-MXP base installation
	 - Make sure you have the libraries installed in the default directory before 	cloning and opening in Eclipse! If you don't, your gonna have a bad time.
- Sections for different code segments (auto, vision, etc)
- Basic robot drive program w/ shifter and thing to grab bar with (goingUpA/B)
- Based on ArcadeDrive, per Drive Team's request
- Full SmartDashboard setup for determining what each defense is, where to breach, and if we even should breach
- Switcher to breach a given defense position
- Autonomous framework using switch cases to determine current stage
- Main joystick (arcade drive) and specials joystick
- Start of shooter code (don't know exactly what this will be yet, just a placeholder)
